<p>Is this the best season in IPL history? Is this the best final in IPL history? If you keep track of the whole tournament and watch last night&#8217;s Ruddhaswath final, most of the cricket fans will probably say &#8216;yes&#8217; to these two questions.</p>



<p>Returning to the home-away format after 4 years after dealing with the shock of Corona, Rinku Singh hitting five sixes in the last five balls to win the team, Virat Kohli regaining himself, Faf du Plessis&#8217; old bone Velki, Yasswi Jaiswal -Akash Madhwal&#8217;s rise, Shubman Gill&#8217;s incredible form, on the third day Ravindra Jadeja&#8217;s steely nerves with 10 runs in the last 2 balls of the made final and Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#8217;s surprise to win the title &#8211; what was not in this IPL?</p>



<p>The surprise was also the prize money of the tournament. The Indian Cricket Board (BCCI) has given a record prize money of more than 60 crore 31 lakh rupees in this season, which is more than the last T20 World Cup held in Australia in October-November last year! The ICC gave a total of 60.3 million rupees in financial prizes in the World Cup.</p>



<p>This year&#8217;s champion Dhoni&#8217;s Chennai Super Kings got Tk 25 crore 94 lakh, runner-up Gujarat Titans got Tk 16 crore 86 lakh. Apart from this, awards were given in many other categories including highest run scorer, highest wicket taker, best player of the tournament.</p>
